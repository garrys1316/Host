The SShield security system is an AI-powered real-time security monitor that blocks 99.998% of attacks. This is crucial for protecting your silkpunk site from malware and other online threats.

### Performance and Speed
Scala Hosting utilizes high-performance SSD storage and LiteSpeed web servers to deliver fast loading speeds. They also offer a global content delivery network (CDN) to ensure your website content is delivered quickly to users around the world. Fast loading times are essential for providing a good user experience and improving your site's search engine ranking.

### Pricing
Scala Hosting offers a range of VPS plans with varying resources, starting at affordable prices. Their entry-level VPS plans are a good option for small to medium-sized silkpunk websites, while their higher-tier plans can accommodate larger, more complex sites.
