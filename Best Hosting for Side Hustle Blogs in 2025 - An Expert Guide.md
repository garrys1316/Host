Scala Hosting offers a compelling blend of performance, security, and customer support, making it a solid choice for side hustle blogs. Their managed VPS hosting is particularly attractive for those seeking more control and scalability.

### SPanel:

It includes features like one-click WordPress installation, email management, DNS management, and more. SPanel is completely free to use on Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans, which helps keep costs down.

### Managed VPS Hosting:
Scala Hosting shines with its managed VPS hosting. These plans provide dedicated resources, ensuring your blog performs optimally even during traffic spikes. Management includes server setup, security patching, monitoring, and proactive support. This allows you to focus on your content rather than server administration. You get root access for advanced customization, but with the support of Scala Hosting's experts.

### Security Features:
Scala Hosting places a strong emphasis on security. Their servers are protected by advanced firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and real-time malware scanning. They also offer free SSL certificates, which are essential for encrypting data transmitted between your blog and visitors. Additionally, they offer automated daily backups, so you can easily restore your blog in case of data loss.

### Customer Support:
Scala Hosting's customer support is available 24/7 via live chat, phone, and email. They are known for their quick response times and knowledgeable staff. Their support team can assist with a wide range of issues, from basic setup questions to more complex server configurations.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting offers a variety of hosting plans to suit different needs and budgets. Shared hosting plans start at affordable prices, while managed VPS plans offer more power and flexibility. Their pricing is competitive, and they often offer discounts for long-term contracts. A key benefit is the cost-effectiveness of their SPanel-powered VPS solutions.
